## Description:

    This is my portfolio, with links to deployed projects I have worked on with their corresponding git hub repositories. There is a page with a downloadable link to my resume and a page with a contact form to get in touch with me.

## Installation:

    In the root of the folder simply run 'npm i' in the command line to install all required dependencies.

## Usage:

    Once all dependencies are installed run the command 'npm start' to activate the server and open the page in the browser.
